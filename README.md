Exercises for the S4 Summer School. 
Jupyter Notebook exploring OpenAlex as a suitable data source to track published datasets. OpenAlex aggregates and standardizes data from numerous sources, including MAG, CrossRef and Subject-area and institutional repositories (e.g. Zenodo).

There are various registration agencies for the persistent identifier DOI. Crossref registers scholarly and professional research content, such as journal articles, books, conference proceedings, etc. DataCite is also an organization that provides DOIs for research data and all other research outputs. Therefore, throughout this notebook, we will compare our results pulled from the OpenAlex API to those availale from Datacite Commons (https://commons.datacite.org/), a web search interface for the PID Graph. Querying the DataCite's APIs is out of scope for this notebook.
